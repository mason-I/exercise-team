# Adjusting Week

## Instructions
1. Open `plans/<week_start>.json` and `plans/<week_start>.md`.
2. Apply the constraints conservatively:
   - Reduce volume before increasing intensity.
   - Preserve the long session unless it conflicts with constraints.
   - Note deviations in `flags`.
3. Update both YAML and Markdown outputs with the rationale.
